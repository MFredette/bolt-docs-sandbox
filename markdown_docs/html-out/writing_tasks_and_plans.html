You might need to restart a service, run a troubleshooting script, or get a list of the network connections to a given node. You perform actions like these with Puppet tasks and plans.</p></div><article class="topic nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title2" id="tasks"><h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title2">Tasks</h2><div class="body"><p class="p">Tasks are single actions that you run on target machines in your infrastructure. You use tasks to make as-needed changes to remote systems.</p><p class="p">You can write tasks in any programming language that can run on the target nodes, such as Bash, Python, or Ruby. Tasks are packaged within modules, so you can reuse, download, and share tasks on the Forge. Task metadata describes the task, validates input, and controls how the task runner executes the task.</p></div></article><article class="topic nested1" aria-labelledby="ariaid-title3" id="plans"><h2 class="title topictitle2" id="ariaid-title3">Plans</h2><div class="body"><p class="p">Plans are sets of tasks that can be combined with other logic. This allows you to do complex task operations, such as running multiple tasks with one command, computing values for the input for a task, or running certain tasks based on results of another task. You write plans in the Puppet language. And like tasks, plans are packaged in modules and can be shared on the Forge.</p><ul class="ul"><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b"><a class="xref" href="inspecting_tasks_and_plans.html">Inspecting tasks and plans</a></strong>Before you run tasks or plans in your environment, inspect them to determine what effect they have on your target nodes.</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b"><a class="xref" href="bolt_running_tasks.html#">Running tasks</a></strong>Bolt can run Puppet tasks on remote nodes without requiring any Puppet infrastructure.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b"><a class="xref" href="bolt_running_plans.html#">Running plans</a></strong>Bolt can run plans, allowing multiple tasks to be tied together.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b"><a class="xref" href="bolt_installing_modules.html#">Installing modules</a></strong>Tasks and plans are packaged in Puppet modules, so you can install them as you would any module and manage them with a Puppetfile.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="li"><p class="p"><strong class="ph b"><a class="xref" href="directory_structure.html#">Directory structures for tasks and plans</a></strong>Puppet tasks, plans, functions, classes and types must exist inside a Puppet, module in order for Bolt to load them.
